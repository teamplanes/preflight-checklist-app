# The Planes Preflight Checklist App

üëãüèº welcome, this Git repository holds the boilerplate used for the Planes
engineering challenge.

During the hour-long challenge you'll be pair programming with a member of the
Planes engineering team, both collaborating to develop the project into a
working app! We ask the candidate to "drive" (sharing your screen) and your
paired engineer is there to guide your through the features.

## Prep Work
**Sometime before the call please run through the following steps**, just so we
can be sure to get the most from the session.
- Clone the repo
- `cd` and `yarn/npm install`
- Make sure the project runs in your browser by running `npm run dev` and
  visiting the URL output by the Next.js CLI
- [optional] It'd be great to make sure you have `eslint` in VScode (or similar)
  just to make sure you are keeping inline with our coding standards, but you
  won't be marked down if you don't have this setup!
- Disable GitHub Copilot, if you have it installed
- Have a look at the code but try not to make any changes
- **Please make sure you have your browser permissions set such that you can share your screen on the call**

## What to Expect
- Your paired engineer will be talking you through features or updates that we
  want to make to this project, they'll start easy and get slightly more
  advanced throughout the session
- Google-ing is fine! It's part of our job, however please share your entire
  screen on the call
- Asking your pair questions about the code or feature is encouraged, they
  aren't there to watch you code, they are there to collaborate
- No need to push/host your code after the call
- You won't be doing any actual UI/CSS/Styling, it'll mostly be logic based (so
  think hooks, props, map, etc).
- The `main` branch of this project has the TypeScript version of the project,
  however you can checkout into the `javascript` branch if you'd prefer to work
  with that - you won't be marked down if you do!
